# Interactive Web Map
India States interactive webmap was designed using the Leaflet library and styled using Bootstrap 5 by hosting using GitHub. The user can have access to the following:
1) Allowing to search for a certain state name, which displays the dummy population of the corresponding state
2) Automatically highlights and zooms to the state searched
3) Shows a set of random states and their population every time the site is refreshed.
4) Displaying the state name on clicking the state.

*Tools and Libraries used:*
Leaflet.js for interactive map rendering
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building core functionality
GeoJSON data(Indian_States.geojson) for state boundaries
Bootstrap 5 for a clean, responsive layout
Geany – a lightweight editor used for writing and editing code
Github – used for free and easy web hosting

*Steps to run the project*
The code editing for map designing was done using Geany, an open-source text editor that gives a versatile interface to edit the HTML scripts
The map was published using GitHub,  a web-based platform for developing or hosting websites and repositories. It should be ensured that while hosting, the following files are essential:
	index.html ----> main file that helps in running the interactive map
  styles.css ----> CSS file for layout and styling 
  app.js -----> JavaScript file with Leaflet and interactivity logic  
	data.geojson -----> data which is added as a layer in the webmap

*Learning Insights*
This task has enabled me to learn about a basic workflow and understanding of publishing an interactive webmap using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and has given me hands-on experience on:
   Creating dynamic layers and popups
   Designing responsive layouts using Bootstrap
   Adding search functionality and sidebar UI
   HosTING AND Publishing interactive maps online using GitHub
